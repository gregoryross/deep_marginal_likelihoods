Parametric model $p(x|\theta)$ compared to to the true $p_t(x)$. As N tends to infinity, the expected log likelihood has the maximum:
\begin{align}
    \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \ln q(x) &= \int p_t(x) \ln q(x) dx \\
    & < - H(x)
\end{align}
The difference between the two is the KL divergence.

In some model selection frameworks [which: AIC and Minimum description length], it is useful to consider the ``true'' data generating probability distribution, denoted here $p_t(x)$. 

In many model selection frameworks the `true'' data generating probability distribution, denoted $p_t(x)$, plays a key role. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$, the (Shannon) entropy of $p_t(x)$ 
\begin{align}
    H_t(x) = -\int p_t(x) \ln\left( p_t(x)\right) dx 
\end{align}
is the minimum length a 

As utilized by Akaike, $H_t(x)$ is the negative of the maximum expected log likelihood. From the perspective of the minimum description length principal, $H_t(x)$ is smallest possible length of a description that can be made of data generated from $p_t(x)$. 

When $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ The (Shannon) entropy of $p_t(x)$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    H_t(x) = -\int p_t(x) \ln\left( p_t(x)\right) dx 
\end{align}
In information theory, the entropy is the shortest length of an encoding of $p_t(x)$ that can be made. If a it assumed that a message has been generated from a probability distribution $q(x)$ that is different from the true distribution, the expected increase in message length is given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence
\begin{align}
    \infdiv[\big]{p_t(x)}{q(x)} = \int p_t(x) \ln\frac{p_t(x)}{q(x)} dx
\end{align}
Clearly, $q(x)$ must have the same support as $p_t(x)$ if \infdiv[\big]{p_t(x)}{q(x)} is to be finite. More generally, the KL divergence is a measure of difference, but not distance, between two distributions. It is always greater than or equal to zero, and increases in value the more different $q(x)$ is from $p(x)$.
